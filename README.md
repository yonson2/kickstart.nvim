# kickstart.nvim

## Introduction

This is my fork of [kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim/) adapted to my liking, go to the official repo for a proper neovim kickstart. (the readme over there also has a lot more info about the project that is useful)

## Installation
Clone kickstart.nvim:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yonson2/kickstart.nvim.git "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"/nvim
```
